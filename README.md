# Black-Bar-Chrome-Extension
This code will someday become a Chrome extension to read then censor student names whilst grading work submitted through Canvas (Developer: Instructure; Product Type: LMS). The aim of this project is to allow TAs to proactively mitigate making biased grading judgments due to assumptions made based on student names (e.g. sex or ethnicity).
